# WP-Branches-For-Post
WordPress plugin for creating branches of publishing post.

This plugin will create a branch with the same content as the original post/page.  
Use it you can modify and publish post in public without affecting them.


When you click on a branch's publish button (Of course, you can also use it for schedule).  
The content of the branch will be inherited to the original post/page, after which the branch will be deleted.  
Things inherited include post, post_meta, taxonomies, attachments and revision.
